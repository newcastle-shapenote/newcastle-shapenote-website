title: About Sacred Harp
---
Sacred Harp is a community folk hymn singing tradition from the United States. The Sacred Harp is also the name of the book we sing from.

Our singings are friendly and open to everyone. We don't rehearse or perform and no-one's in charge. Everyone just sings for their own enjoyment. You don't need to be able to read music yet or have a "good" voice to come along.

Anybody is welcome to walk in, find a seat, and join in with the singing. You will be gently encouraged to join in regardless of whether you think you are a good singer. The atmosphere will be relaxed. At all-day singings, there will be plenty of food.
